#testcases filelog compatibility changeset sidedata upgraded upgraded-parallel

=====================================================
Test Copy tracing for chain of copies involving merge
=====================================================

This test files covers copies/rename case for a chains of commit where merges
are involved. It cheks we do not have unwanted update of behavior and that the
different options to retrieve copies behave correctly.


Setup
=====

use git diff to see rename

  $ cat << EOF >> ./no-linkrev
  > #!$PYTHON
  > # filter out linkrev part of the debugindex command
  > import sys
  > for line in sys.stdin:
  >     if " linkrev " in line:
  >         print(line.rstrip())
  >     else:
  >         l = "%s       *%s" % (line[:6], line[14:].rstrip())
  >         print(l)
  > EOF

  $ cat << EOF >> $HGRCPATH
  > [diff]
  > git=yes
  > [command-templates]
  > log={desc}\n
  > EOF

#if compatibility

#if changeset
  $ cat >> $HGRCPATH << EOF

  > EOF
#endif


  $ cat > same-content.txt << EOF
  > Here is some content that will be the same accros multiple file.
  > 
  > This is done on purpose so that we end up in some merge situation, were the

  > EOF

  $ hg init repo-chain
  $ cd repo-chain

Add some linear rename initialy

  $ cp ../same-content.txt a
  $ cp ../same-content.txt b
  $ cp ../same-content.txt h
  $ echo "original content for P" > p
  $ echo "original content for Q" > q
  $ echo "original content for R" > r
  $ hg ci -Am 'i-0 initial commit: a b h p q r'
  adding a
  adding b
  adding h
  adding p
  adding q
  adding r
  $ hg mv a c
  $ hg mv p s
  $ hg ci -Am 'i-1: a -move-> c, p -move-> s'
  $ hg mv c d
  $ hg mv s t
  $ hg ci -Am 'i-2: c -move-> d, s -move-> t'

  |
  o  i-1: a -move-> c, p -move-> s
  |
  o  i-0 initial commit: a b h p q r
  

And having another branch with renames on the other side

  $ hg mv d e
  $ hg ci -Am 'a-1: d -move-> e'
  $ hg mv e f
  $ hg ci -Am 'a-2: e -move-> f'
  $ hg log -G --rev '::.'

  |
  o  i-1: a -move-> c, p -move-> s
  |
  o  i-0 initial commit: a b h p q r
  

Have a branching with nothing on one side

  $ hg up 'desc("i-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 1 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ echo foo > b
  $ hg ci -m 'b-1: b update'
  created new head

  |
  o  i-1: a -move-> c, p -move-> s
  |
  o  i-0 initial commit: a b h p q r
  

Create a branch that delete a file previous renamed

  $ hg up 'desc("i-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg rm d

Create a branch that delete a file previous renamed and recreate it

  $ hg up 'desc("i-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg rm d
  $ hg ci -m 'd-1 delete d'
  created new head
  $ echo bar > d

  $ hg up 'desc("i-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg mv b g
  $ hg ci -m 'e-1 b -move-> g'

Setup all merge
===============

This is done beforehand to validate that the upgrade process creates valid copy
information.

merging with unrelated change does not interfere with the renames
---------------------------------------------------------------

- rename on one side
- unrelated change on the other side

  $ case_desc="simple merge - A side: multiple renames, B side: unrelated update"

  $ hg up 'desc("b-1")'

  $ hg merge 'desc("a-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 1 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  (branch merge, don't forget to commit)
  $ hg ci -m "mBAm-0 $case_desc - one way"
  $ hg up 'desc("a-2")'
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ hg merge 'desc("b-1")'

  (branch merge, don't forget to commit)

Subcase: merging a change to a file with a "copy overwrite" to that file from another branch
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Merge:
- one with change to a file (d)
- one overwriting that file with a rename (from h to i, to d)

This case is similar to BF/FB, but an actual merge happens, so both side of the
history are relevant.

Note:
| In this case, the merge get conflicting information since on one side we have
| "a -> c -> d". and one the other one we have "h -> i -> d".

Comparing with merging with a deletion (and keeping the file)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Merge:
- one removing a file (d)
- one updating that file
- the merge keep the modified version of the file (canceling the delete)

In this case, the file keep on living after the merge. So we should not drop its
copy tracing chain.

  $ hg up 'desc("c-1")'

rename information actually conflict with the other branch.

Subcase: chaining conflicting rename resolution
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The "mAEm" and "mEAm" case create a rename tracking conflict on file 'f'. We
add more change on the respective branch and merge again. These second merge
does not involve the file 'f' and the arbitration done within "mAEm" and "mEA"
about that file should stay unchanged.

We also touch J during some of the merge to check for unrelated change to new file during merge.

Subcase: chaining conflicting rename resolution, with actual merging happening
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The "mPQm" and "mQPm" case create a rename tracking conflict on file 't'. We
add more change on the respective branch and merge again. These second merge
does not involve the file 't' and the arbitration done within "mPQm" and "mQP"
about that file should stay unchanged.

Test that sidedata computations during upgrades are correct
===========================================================

We upgrade a repository that is not using sidedata (the filelog case) and
 check that the same side data have been generated as if they were computed at
 commit time.

Test copy information chaining
==============================

Check that matching only affect the destination and not intermediate path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two status call should give the same value for f

  $ hg status --copies --rev 'desc("i-0")' --rev 'desc("a-2")'
  A f
    a
  A t
    p
  R a
  R p
  $ hg status --copies --rev 'desc("i-0")' --rev 'desc("a-2")' f
  A f
    a (no-changeset no-compatibility !)

merging with unrelated change does not interfere with the renames
---------------------------------------------------------------

- rename on one side
- unrelated change on the other side

  $ hg log -G --rev '::(desc("mABm")+desc("mBAm"))'

Subcase: reset of the copy history on one side
``````````````````````````````````````````````

Merge:
- one with change to a file
- one deleting and recreating the file

Unlike in the 'BD/DB' cases, an actual merge happened here. So we should
consider history and rename on both branch of the merge.

  $ hg log -G --rev '::(desc("mDGm")+desc("mGDm"))'
  o    mGDm-0 actual content merge, copies on one side - D side: delete and re-add (different content), G side: update content - the other way
  |\

  | |
  o |  d-1 delete d

  |

One side of the merge have a long history with rename. The other side of the
merge point to a new file with a smaller history. Each side is "valid".

(and again the filelog based algorithm only explore one, with a pick based on
revision numbers)

Subcase: merging a change to a file with a "copy overwrite" to that file from another branch
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Merge:
- one with change to a file (d)
- one overwriting that file with a rename (from h to i, to d)

This case is similar to BF/FB, but an actual merge happens, so both side of the
history are relevant.


  $ hg log -G --rev '::(desc("mGFm")+desc("mFGm"))'
  o    mGFm-0 merge - G side: content change, F side: copy overwrite, no content change - the other way
  |\
  +---o  mFGm-0 merge - G side: content change, F side: copy overwrite, no content change - one way
  | |/
  | o  g-1: update d
  | |
  o |  f-2: rename i -> d
  | |
  o |  f-1: rename h -> i
  |/
  o  i-2: c -move-> d, s -move-> t
  |
  o  i-1: a -move-> c, p -move-> s
  |
  o  i-0 initial commit: a b h p q r
  

Note:
| In this case, the merge get conflicting information since on one side we have
| "a -> c -> d". and one the other one we have "h -> i -> d".
|
| The current code arbitrarily pick one side depending the ordering of the merged hash:

In this case, the file hash from "f-2" is lower, so it will be `p1` of the resulting filenode its copy tracing information will win (and trace back to "h"):

Details on this hash ordering pick:

In this case, the file keep on living after the merge. So we should not drop its
copy tracing chain.
