Commands
--------

.. _add:

``add [OPTION]... [FILE]...``
    Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
    repository.

    The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
    undo an add before that, see :hg:`forget`.

    If no names are given, add all files to the repository.

    .. container:: verbose

       An example showing how new (unknown) files are added
       automatically by :hg:`add`::

         $ ls
         foo.c
         $ hg status
         ? foo.c
         $ hg add
         adding foo.c
         $ hg status
         A foo.c

    Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

    options:

    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
    -n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

.. _addremove:

``addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...``
    Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
    repository.

    New files are ignored if they match any of the patterns in
    .hgignore. As with add, these changes take effect at the next
    commit.

    Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files. With a
    parameter greater than 0, this compares every removed file with
    every added file and records those similar enough as renames. This
    option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must
    be identical) as its parameter. Detecting renamed files this way
    can be expensive. After using this option, :hg:`status -C` can be
    used to check which files were identified as moved or renamed.

    Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

    options:

    -s, --similarity  guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)
    -I, --include     include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude     exclude names matching the given patterns
    -n, --dry-run     do not perform actions, just print output

.. _annotate:

``annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...``
    List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for
    each line

    This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and
    by whom.

    Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid processing files
    it detects as binary. With -a, annotate will annotate the file
    anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful
    nor desirable.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -r, --rev          annotate the specified revision
    --follow           follow copies/renames and list the filename (DEPRECATED)
    --no-follow        don't follow copies and renames
    -a, --text         treat all files as text
    -u, --user         list the author (long with -v)
    -f, --file         list the filename
    -d, --date         list the date (short with -q)
    -n, --number       list the revision number (default)
    -c, --changeset    list the changeset
    -l, --line-number  show line number at the first appearance
    -I, --include      include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude      exclude names matching the given patterns

    aliases: blame

.. _archive:

``archive [OPTION]... DEST``
    By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
    directory; use -r/--rev to specify a different revision.

    The archive type is automatically detected based on file
    extension (or override using -t/--type).

    Valid types are:

    :``files``: a directory full of files (default)
    :``tar``:   tar archive, uncompressed
    :``tbz2``:  tar archive, compressed using bzip2
    :``tgz``:   tar archive, compressed using gzip
    :``uzip``:  zip archive, uncompressed
    :``zip``:   zip archive, compressed using deflate

    The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
    using a format string; see :hg:`help export` for details.

    Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
    prepended. Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string for the
    prefix. The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes
    removed.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    --no-decode    do not pass files through decoders
    -p, --prefix   directory prefix for files in archive
    -r, --rev      revision to distribute
    -t, --type     type of distribution to create
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _backout:

``backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV``
    Commit the backed out changes as a new changeset. The new
    changeset is a child of the backed out changeset.

    If you backout a changeset other than the tip, a new head is
    created. This head will be the new tip and you should merge this
    backout changeset with another head.

    The --merge option remembers the parent of the working directory
    before starting the backout, then merges the new head with that
    changeset afterwards. This saves you from doing the merge by hand.
    The result of this merge is not committed, as with a normal merge.

    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    --merge        merge with old dirstate parent after backout
    --parent       parent to choose when backing out merge
    -r, --rev      revision to backout
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
    -m, --message  use text as commit message
    -l, --logfile  read commit message from file
    -d, --date     record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user     record the specified user as committer

.. _bisect:

``bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]``
    This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To
    use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as
    bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem
    as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision
    for testing (unless the -U/--noupdate option is specified). Once
    you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
    bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
    or announce that it has found the bad revision.

    As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
    revision as good or bad without checking it out first.

    If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
    Its exit status will be used to mark revisions as good or bad:
    status 0 means good, 125 means to skip the revision, 127
    (command not found) will abort the bisection, and any other
    non-zero exit status means the revision is bad.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -r, --reset     reset bisect state
    -g, --good      mark changeset good
    -b, --bad       mark changeset bad
    -s, --skip      skip testing changeset
    -c, --command   use command to check changeset state
    -U, --noupdate  do not update to target

.. _branch:

``branch [-fC] [NAME]``
    With no argument, show the current branch name. With one argument,
    set the working directory branch name (the branch will not exist
    in the repository until the next commit). Standard practice
    recommends that primary development take place on the 'default'
    branch.

    Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you set a
    branch name that already exists, even if it's inactive.

    Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to that of
    the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch
    change.

    Use the command :hg:`update` to switch to an existing branch. Use
    :hg:`commit --close-branch` to mark this branch as closed.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -f, --force  set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch
    -C, --clean  reset branch name to parent branch name

.. _branches:

``branches [-ac]``
    List the repository's named branches, indicating which ones are
    inactive. If -c/--closed is specified, also list branches which have
    been marked closed (see :hg:`commit --close-branch`).

    If -a/--active is specified, only show active branches. A branch
    is considered active if it contains repository heads.

    Use the command :hg:`update` to switch to an existing branch.

    Returns 0.

    options:

    -a, --active  show only branches that have unmerged heads
    -c, --closed  show normal and closed branches

.. _bundle:

``bundle [-f] [-t TYPE] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE [DEST]``
    Generate a compressed changegroup file collecting changesets not
    known to be in another repository.

    If you omit the destination repository, then hg assumes the
    destination will have all the nodes you specify with --base
    parameters. To create a bundle containing all changesets, use
    -a/--all (or --base null).

    You can change compression method with the -t/--type option.
    The available compression methods are: none, bzip2, and
    gzip (by default, bundles are compressed using bzip2).

    The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
    and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
    command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
    available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.

    Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
    permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.

    options:

    -f, --force   run even when the destination is unrelated
    -r, --rev     a changeset intended to be added to the destination
    -b, --branch  a specific branch you would like to bundle
    --base        a base changeset assumed to be available at the destination
    -a, --all     bundle all changesets in the repository
    -t, --type    bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)
    -e, --ssh     specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd   specify hg command to run on the remote side

.. _cat:

``cat [OPTION]... FILE...``
    Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If
    no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used,
    or tip if no revision is checked out.

    Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
    given using a format string. The formatting rules are the same as
    for the export command, with the following additions:

    :``%s``: basename of file being printed
    :``%d``: dirname of file being printed, or '.' if in repository root
    :``%p``: root-relative path name of file being printed

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -o, --output   print output to file with formatted name
    -r, --rev      print the given revision
    --decode       apply any matching decode filter
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _clone:

``clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]``
    Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

    If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
    basename of the source.

    The location of the source is added to the new repository's
    .hg/hgrc file, as the default to be used for future pulls.

    See :hg:`help urls` for valid source format details.

    It is possible to specify an ``ssh://`` URL as the destination, but no
    .hg/hgrc and working directory will be created on the remote side.
    Please see :hg:`help urls` for important details about ``ssh://`` URLs.

    A set of changesets (tags, or branch names) to pull may be specified
    by listing each changeset (tag, or branch name) with -r/--rev.
    If -r/--rev is used, the cloned repository will contain only a subset
    of the changesets of the source repository. Only the set of changesets
    defined by all -r/--rev options (including all their ancestors)
    will be pulled into the destination repository.
    No subsequent changesets (including subsequent tags) will be present
    in the destination.

    Using -r/--rev (or 'clone src#rev dest') implies --pull, even for
    local source repositories.

    For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the source
    and destination are on the same filesystem (note this applies only
    to the repository data, not to the working directory). Some
    filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking incorrectly, but
    do not report errors. In these cases, use the --pull option to
    avoid hardlinking.

    In some cases, you can clone repositories and the working directory
    using full hardlinks with ::

      $ cp -al REPO REPOCLONE

    This is the fastest way to clone, but it is not always safe. The
    operation is not atomic (making sure REPO is not modified during
    the operation is up to you) and you have to make sure your editor
    breaks hardlinks (Emacs and most Linux Kernel tools do so). Also,
    this is not compatible with certain extensions that place their
    metadata under the .hg directory, such as mq.

    Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable
    revision from this list:

    a) null if -U or the source repository has no changesets
    b) if -u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of
       the source repository's working directory
    c) the changeset specified with -u (if a branch name, this means the
       latest head of that branch)
    d) the changeset specified with -r
    e) the tipmost head specified with -b
    f) the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax
    g) the tipmost head of the default branch
    h) tip

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -U, --noupdate   the clone will include an empty working copy (only a repository)
    -u, --updaterev  revision, tag or branch to check out
    -r, --rev        include the specified changeset
    -b, --branch     clone only the specified branch
    --pull           use pull protocol to copy metadata
    --uncompressed   use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)
    -e, --ssh        specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd      specify hg command to run on the remote side

.. _commit:

``commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...``
    Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a
    centralized RCS, this operation is a local operation. See
    :hg:`push` for a way to actively distribute your changes.

    If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by :hg:`status`
    will be committed.

    If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any
    filenames or -I/-X filters.

    If no commit message is specified, the configured editor is
    started to prompt you for a message.

    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing changed.

    options:

    -A, --addremove  mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing
    --close-branch   mark a branch as closed, hiding it from the branch list
    -I, --include    include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns
    -m, --message    use text as commit message
    -l, --logfile    read commit message from file
    -d, --date       record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user       record the specified user as committer

    aliases: ci

.. _copy:

``copy [OPTION]... [SOURCE]... DEST``
    Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
    directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file,
    the source must be a single file.

    By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
    exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
    operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

    This command takes effect with the next commit. To undo a copy
    before that, see :hg:`revert`.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

    options:

    -A, --after    record a copy that has already occurred
    -f, --force    forcibly copy over an existing managed file
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
    -n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

    aliases: cp

.. _diff:

``diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...``
    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

    NOTE: diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
    default to comparing against the working directory's first parent
    changeset if no revisions are specified.

    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown
    between those revisions. If only one revision is specified then
    that revision is compared to the working directory, and, when no
    revisions are specified, the working directory files are compared
    to its parent.

    Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see
    the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.

    Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
    files it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff
    anyway, probably with undesirable results.

    Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
    format. For more information, read :hg:`help diffs`.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -r, --rev                  revision
    -c, --change               change made by revision
    -a, --text                 treat all files as text
    -g, --git                  use git extended diff format
    --nodates                  omit dates from diff headers
    -p, --show-function        show which function each change is in
    --reverse                  produce a diff that undoes the changes
    -w, --ignore-all-space     ignore white space when comparing lines
    -b, --ignore-space-change  ignore changes in the amount of white space
    -B, --ignore-blank-lines   ignore changes whose lines are all blank
    -U, --unified              number of lines of context to show
    --stat                     output diffstat-style summary of changes
    -I, --include              include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude              exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _export:

``export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] REV...``
    Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.

    The information shown in the changeset header is: author, date,
    branch name (if non-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit
    comment.

    NOTE: export may generate unexpected diff output for merge
    changesets, as it will compare the merge changeset against its
    first parent only.

    Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
    given using a format string. The formatting rules are as follows:

    :``%%``: literal "%" character
    :``%H``: changeset hash (40 bytes of hexadecimal)
    :``%N``: number of patches being generated
    :``%R``: changeset revision number
    :``%b``: basename of the exporting repository
    :``%h``: short-form changeset hash (12 bytes of hexadecimal)
    :``%n``: zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1
    :``%r``: zero-padded changeset revision number

    Without the -a/--text option, export will avoid generating diffs
    of files it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a
    diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.

    Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
    format. See :hg:`help diffs` for more information.

    With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be against the
    second parent. It can be useful to review a merge.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -o, --output     print output to file with formatted name
    --switch-parent  diff against the second parent
    -r, --rev        revisions to export
    -a, --text       treat all files as text
    -g, --git        use git extended diff format
    --nodates        omit dates from diff headers

.. _forget:

``forget [OPTION]... FILE...``
    Mark the specified files so they will no longer be tracked
    after the next commit.

    This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
    entire project history, and it does not delete them from the
    working directory.

    To undo a forget before the next commit, see :hg:`add`.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _grep:

``grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...``
    Search revisions of files for a regular expression.

    This command behaves differently than Unix grep. It only accepts
    Python/Perl regexps. It searches repository history, not the
    working directory. It always prints the revision number in which a
    match appears.

    By default, grep only prints output for the first revision of a
    file in which it finds a match. To get it to print every revision
    that contains a change in match status ("-" for a match that
    becomes a non-match, or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match),
    use the --all flag.

    Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

    options:

    -0, --print0              end fields with NUL
    --all                     print all revisions that match
    -f, --follow              follow changeset history, or file history across copies and renames
    -i, --ignore-case         ignore case when matching
    -l, --files-with-matches  print only filenames and revisions that match
    -n, --line-number         print matching line numbers
    -r, --rev                 only search files changed within revision range
    -u, --user                list the author (long with -v)
    -d, --date                list the date (short with -q)
    -I, --include             include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude             exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _heads:

``heads [-ac] [-r REV] [REV]...``
    With no arguments, show all repository branch heads.

    Repository "heads" are changesets with no child changesets. They are
    where development generally takes place and are the usual targets
    for update and merge operations. Branch heads are changesets that have
    no child changeset on the same branch.

    If one or more REVs are given, only branch heads on the branches
    associated with the specified changesets are shown.

    If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed
    (see :hg:`commit --close-branch`).

    If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants of
    STARTREV will be displayed.

    If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics will be ignored and only
    changesets without children will be shown.

    Returns 0 if matching heads are found, 1 if not.

    options:

    -r, --rev     show only heads which are descendants of REV
    -t, --topo    show topological heads only
    -a, --active  show active branchheads only [DEPRECATED]
    -c, --closed  show normal and closed branch heads
    --style       display using template map file
    --template    display with template

.. _help:

``help [TOPIC]``
    With no arguments, print a list of commands with short help messages.

    Given a topic, extension, or command name, print help for that
    topic.

    Returns 0 if successful.

.. _identify:

``identify [-nibt] [-r REV] [SOURCE]``
    With no revision, print a summary of the current state of the
    repository.

    Specifying a path to a repository root or Mercurial bundle will
    cause lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

    This summary identifies the repository state using one or two
    parent hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if there are
    uncommitted changes in the working directory, a list of tags for
    this revision and a branch name for non-default branches.

    Returns 0 if successful.

    options:

    -r, --rev     identify the specified revision
    -n, --num     show local revision number
    -i, --id      show global revision id
    -b, --branch  show branch
    -t, --tags    show tags

    aliases: id

.. _import:

``import [OPTION]... PATCH...``
    Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless
    --no-commit is specified).

    If there are outstanding changes in the working directory, import
    will abort unless given the -f/--force flag.

    You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
    as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
    text/plain or text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of email
    message are used as default committer and commit message. All
    text/plain body parts before first diff are added to commit
    message.

    If the imported patch was generated by :hg:`export`, user and
    description from patch override values from message headers and
    body. Values given on command line with -m/--message and -u/--user
    override these.

    If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
    the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the
    resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in
    the patch. This may happen due to character set problems or other
    deficiencies in the text patch format.

    With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
    copies in the patch in the same way as 'addremove'.

    To read a patch from standard input, use "-" as the patch name. If
    a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from it.
    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -p, --strip       directory strip option for patch. This has the same meaning as the corresponding patch option (default: 1)
    -b, --base        base path
    -f, --force       skip check for outstanding uncommitted changes
    --no-commit       don't commit, just update the working directory
    --exact           apply patch to the nodes from which it was generated
    --import-branch   use any branch information in patch (implied by --exact)
    -m, --message     use text as commit message
    -l, --logfile     read commit message from file
    -d, --date        record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user        record the specified user as committer
    -s, --similarity  guess renamed files by similarity (0<=s<=100)

    aliases: patch

.. _incoming:

``incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle FILENAME] [SOURCE]``
    Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or the default
    pull location. These are the changesets that would have been pulled
    if a pull at the time you issued this command.

    For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading the
    changesets twice if the incoming is followed by a pull.

    See pull for valid source format details.

    Returns 0 if there are incoming changes, 1 otherwise.

    options:

    -f, --force         run even if remote repository is unrelated
    -n, --newest-first  show newest record first
    --bundle            file to store the bundles into
    -r, --rev           a remote changeset intended to be added
    -b, --branch        a specific branch you would like to pull
    -p, --patch         show patch
    -g, --git           use git extended diff format
    -l, --limit         limit number of changes displayed
    -M, --no-merges     do not show merges
    --stat              output diffstat-style summary of changes
    --style             display using template map file
    --template          display with template
    -e, --ssh           specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd         specify hg command to run on the remote side

    aliases: in

.. _init:

``init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]``
    Initialize a new repository in the given directory. If the given
    directory does not exist, it will be created.

    If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

    It is possible to specify an ``ssh://`` URL as the destination.
    See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -e, --ssh    specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd  specify hg command to run on the remote side

.. _locate:

``locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...``
    Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory whose
    names match the given patterns.

    By default, this command searches all directories in the working
    directory. To search just the current directory and its
    subdirectories, use "--include .".

    If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
    of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

    If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
    command, use the -0 option to both this command and "xargs". This
    will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames that
    contain whitespace as multiple filenames.

    Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

    options:

    -r, --rev       search the repository as it is in REV
    -0, --print0    end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
    -f, --fullpath  print complete paths from the filesystem root
    -I, --include   include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude   exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _log:

``log [OPTION]... [FILE]``
    Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire
    project.

    File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
    files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across
    renames and copies. --follow without a filename will only show
    ancestors or descendants of the starting revision. --follow-first
    only follows the first parent of merge revisions.

    If no revision range is specified, the default is tip:0 unless
    --follow is set, in which case the working directory parent is
    used as the starting revision. You can specify a revision set for
    log, see :hg:`help revsets` for more information.

    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,
    tags, non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for
    each commit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of
    changed files and full commit message are shown.

    NOTE: log -p/--patch may generate unexpected diff output for merge
    changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against
    its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents
    will appear in files:.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -f, --follow       follow changeset history, or file history across copies and renames
    --follow-first     only follow the first parent of merge changesets
    -d, --date         show revisions matching date spec
    -C, --copies       show copied files
    -k, --keyword      do case-insensitive search for a given text
    -r, --rev          show the specified revision or range
    --removed          include revisions where files were removed
    -m, --only-merges  show only merges
    -u, --user         revisions committed by user
    --only-branch      show only changesets within the given named branch (DEPRECATED)
    -b, --branch       show changesets within the given named branch
    -P, --prune        do not display revision or any of its ancestors
    -p, --patch        show patch
    -g, --git          use git extended diff format
    -l, --limit        limit number of changes displayed
    -M, --no-merges    do not show merges
    --stat             output diffstat-style summary of changes
    --style            display using template map file
    --template         display with template
    -I, --include      include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude      exclude names matching the given patterns

    aliases: history

.. _manifest:

``manifest [-r REV]``
    Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.
    If no revision is given, the first parent of the working directory
    is used, or the null revision if no revision is checked out.

    With -v, print file permissions, symlink and executable bits.
    With --debug, print file revision hashes.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -r, --rev  revision to display

.. _merge:

``merge [-P] [-f] [[-r] REV]``
    The current working directory is updated with all changes made in
    the requested revision since the last common predecessor revision.

    Files that changed between either parent are marked as changed for
    the next commit and a commit must be performed before any further
    updates to the repository are allowed. The next commit will have
    two parents.

    If no revision is specified, the working directory's parent is a
    head revision, and the current branch contains exactly one other
    head, the other head is merged with by default. Otherwise, an
    explicit revision with which to merge with must be provided.

    To undo an uncommitted merge, use :hg:`update --clean .` which
    will check out a clean copy of the original merge parent, losing
    all changes.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

    options:

    -f, --force    force a merge with outstanding changes
    -r, --rev      revision to merge
    -P, --preview  review revisions to merge (no merge is performed)

.. _outgoing:

``outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]``
    Show changesets not found in the specified destination repository
    or the default push location. These are the changesets that would
    be pushed if a push was requested.

    See pull for details of valid destination formats.

    Returns 0 if there are outgoing changes, 1 otherwise.

    options:

    -f, --force         run even when the destination is unrelated
    -r, --rev           a changeset intended to be included in the destination
    -n, --newest-first  show newest record first
    -b, --branch        a specific branch you would like to push
    -p, --patch         show patch
    -g, --git           use git extended diff format
    -l, --limit         limit number of changes displayed
    -M, --no-merges     do not show merges
    --stat              output diffstat-style summary of changes
    --style             display using template map file
    --template          display with template
    -e, --ssh           specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd         specify hg command to run on the remote side

    aliases: out

.. _parents:

``parents [-r REV] [FILE]``
    Print the working directory's parent revisions. If a revision is
    given via -r/--rev, the parent of that revision will be printed.
    If a file argument is given, the revision in which the file was
    last changed (before the working directory revision or the
    argument to --rev if given) is printed.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -r, --rev   show parents of the specified revision
    --style     display using template map file
    --template  display with template

.. _paths:

``paths [NAME]``
    Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is given,
    show definition of all available names.

    Path names are defined in the [paths] section of
    ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc`` and ``$HOME/.hgrc``. If run inside a
    repository, ``.hg/hgrc`` is used, too.

    The path names ``default`` and ``default-push`` have a special
    meaning.  When performing a push or pull operation, they are used
    as fallbacks if no location is specified on the command-line.
    When ``default-push`` is set, it will be used for push and
    ``default`` will be used for pull; otherwise ``default`` is used
    as the fallback for both.  When cloning a repository, the clone
    source is written as ``default`` in ``.hg/hgrc``.  Note that
    ``default`` and ``default-push`` apply to all inbound (e.g.
    :hg:`incoming`) and outbound (e.g. :hg:`outgoing`, :hg:`email` and
    :hg:`bundle`) operations.

    See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

    Returns 0 on success.

.. _pull:

``pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]``
    Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

    This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
    or URL and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless
    -R is specified). By default, this does not update the copy of the
    project in the working directory.

    Use :hg:`incoming` if you want to see what would have been added
    by a pull at the time you issued this command. If you then decide
    to add those changes to the repository, you should use :hg:`pull
    -r X` where ``X`` is the last changeset listed by :hg:`incoming`.

    If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.
    See :hg:`help urls` for more information.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.

    options:

    -u, --update  update to new branch head if changesets were pulled
    -f, --force   run even when remote repository is unrelated
    -r, --rev     a remote changeset intended to be added
    -b, --branch  a specific branch you would like to pull
    -e, --ssh     specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd   specify hg command to run on the remote side

.. _push:

``push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]``
    Push changesets from the local repository to the specified
    destination.

    This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull
    in the destination repository from the current one.

    By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the
    destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which head
    to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge
    before pushing.

    Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named
    branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to
    only create a new branch without forcing other changes.

    Use -f/--force to override the default behavior and push all
    changesets on all branches.

    If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors
    will be pushed to the remote repository.

    Please see :hg:`help urls` for important details about ``ssh://``
    URLs. If DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.

    Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

    options:

    -f, --force   force push
    -r, --rev     a changeset intended to be included in the destination
    -b, --branch  a specific branch you would like to push
    --new-branch  allow pushing a new branch
    -e, --ssh     specify ssh command to use
    --remotecmd   specify hg command to run on the remote side

.. _recover:

``recover``
    Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

    This command tries to fix the repository status after an
    interrupted operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial
    suggests it.

    Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover or verify fails.

.. _remove:

``remove [OPTION]... FILE...``
    Schedule the indicated files for removal from the repository.

    This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
    entire project history. -A/--after can be used to remove only
    files that have already been deleted, -f/--force can be used to
    force deletion, and -Af can be used to remove files from the next
    revision without deleting them from the working directory.

    The following table details the behavior of remove for different
    file states (columns) and option combinations (rows). The file
    states are Added [A], Clean [C], Modified [M] and Missing [!] (as
    reported by :hg:`status`). The actions are Warn, Remove (from
    branch) and Delete (from disk)::

             A  C  M  !
      none   W  RD W  R
      -f     R  RD RD R
      -A     W  W  W  R
      -Af    R  R  R  R

    This command schedules the files to be removed at the next commit.
    To undo a remove before that, see :hg:`revert`.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if any warnings encountered.

    options:

    -A, --after    record delete for missing files
    -f, --force    remove (and delete) file even if added or modified
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

    aliases: rm

.. _rename:

``rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST``
    Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If dest
    is a directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a
    file, there can only be one source.

    By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
    exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
    operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

    This command takes effect at the next commit. To undo a rename
    before that, see :hg:`revert`.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

    options:

    -A, --after    record a rename that has already occurred
    -f, --force    forcibly copy over an existing managed file
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
    -n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

    aliases: mv

.. _resolve:

``resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...``
    This command includes several actions that are often useful while
    performing a merge, after running ``merge`` but before running
    ``commit``.  (It is only meaningful if your working directory has
    two parents.)  It is most relevant for merges with unresolved
    conflicts, which are typically a result of non-interactive merging with
    ``internal:merge`` or a command-line merge tool like ``diff3``.

    The available actions are:

      1) list files that were merged with conflicts (U, for unresolved)
         and without conflicts (R, for resolved): ``hg resolve -l``
         (this is like ``status`` for merges)
      2) record that you have resolved conflicts in certain files:
         ``hg resolve -m [file ...]`` (default: mark all unresolved files)
      3) forget that you have resolved conflicts in certain files:
         ``hg resolve -u [file ...]`` (default: unmark all resolved files)
      4) discard your current attempt(s) at resolving conflicts and
         restart the merge from scratch: ``hg resolve file...``
         (or ``-a`` for all unresolved files)

    Note that Mercurial will not let you commit files with unresolved merge
    conflicts.  You must use ``hg resolve -m ...`` before you can commit
    after a conflicting merge.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.

    options:

    -a, --all        select all unresolved files
    -l, --list       list state of files needing merge
    -m, --mark       mark files as resolved
    -u, --unmark     unmark files as resolved
    -n, --no-status  hide status prefix
    -I, --include    include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns

.. _revert:

``revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...``
    NOTE: This command is most likely not what you are looking for. revert
    will partially overwrite content in the working directory without changing
    the working directory parents. Use :hg:`update -r rev` to check out earlier
    revisions, or :hg:`update --clean .` to undo a merge which has added
    another parent.

    With no revision specified, revert the named files or directories
    to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
    This restores the contents of the affected files to an unmodified
    state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
    working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
    revision.

    Using the -r/--rev option, revert the given files or directories
    to their contents as of a specific revision. This can be helpful
    to "roll back" some or all of an earlier change. See :hg:`help
    dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Revert modifies the working directory. It does not commit any
    changes, or change the parent of the working directory. If you
    revert to a revision other than the parent of the working
    directory, the reverted files will thus appear modified
    afterwards.

    If a file has been deleted, it is restored. If the executable mode
    of a file was changed, it is reset.

    If names are given, all files matching the names are reverted.
    If no arguments are given, no files are reverted.

    Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
    To disable these backups, use --no-backup.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -a, --all      revert all changes when no arguments given
    -d, --date     tipmost revision matching date
    -r, --rev      revert to the specified revision
    --no-backup    do not save backup copies of files
    -I, --include  include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns
    -n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

.. _rollback:

``rollback``
    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
    rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
    restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
    any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
    the working directory.

    Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
    that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
    repository. For example, the following commands are transactional,
    and their effects can be rolled back:

    - commit
    - import
    - pull
    - push (with this repository as the destination)
    - unbundle

    This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
    changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
    back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
    the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
    repository; for example an in-progress pull from the repository
    may fail if a rollback is performed.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

    options:

    -n, --dry-run  do not perform actions, just print output

.. _root:

``root``
    Print the root directory of the current repository.

    Returns 0 on success.

.. _serve:

``serve [OPTION]...``
    Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use
    this for ad-hoc sharing and browing of repositories. It is
    recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
    longer periods of time.

    Please note that the server does not implement access control.
    This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
    nobody can write to it by default. Set the ``web.allow_push``
    option to ``*`` to allow everybody to push to the server. You
    should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.

    By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
    stderr. Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log to
    files.

    To have the server choose a free port number to listen on, specify
    a port number of 0; in this case, the server will print the port
    number it uses.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -A, --accesslog   name of access log file to write to
    -d, --daemon      run server in background
    --daemon-pipefds  used internally by daemon mode
    -E, --errorlog    name of error log file to write to
    -p, --port        port to listen on (default: 8000)
    -a, --address     address to listen on (default: all interfaces)
    --prefix          prefix path to serve from (default: server root)
    -n, --name        name to show in web pages (default: working directory)
    --web-conf        name of the hgweb config file (serve more than one repository)
    --webdir-conf     name of the hgweb config file (DEPRECATED)
    --pid-file        name of file to write process ID to
    --stdio           for remote clients
    -t, --templates   web templates to use
    --style           template style to use
    -6, --ipv6        use IPv6 in addition to IPv4
    --certificate     SSL certificate file

.. _showconfig:

``showconfig [-u] [NAME]...``
    With no arguments, print names and values of all config items.

    With one argument of the form section.name, print just the value
    of that config item.

    With multiple arguments, print names and values of all config
    items with matching section names.

    With --debug, the source (filename and line number) is printed
    for each config item.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -u, --untrusted  show untrusted configuration options

    aliases: debugconfig

.. _status:

``status [OPTION]... [FILE]...``
    Show status of files in the repository. If names are given, only
    files that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or
    the source of a copy/move operation, are not listed unless
    -c/--clean, -i/--ignored, -C/--copies or -A/--all are given.
    Unless options described with "show only ..." are given, the
    options -mardu are used.

    Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files
    unless explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

    NOTE: status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have
    changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not
    report permission changes and diff only reports changes relative
    to one merge parent.

    If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.
    If two revisions are given, the differences between them are
    shown. The --change option can also be used as a shortcut to list
    the changed files of a revision from its first parent.

    The codes used to show the status of files are::

      M = modified
      A = added
      R = removed
      C = clean
      ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
      ? = not tracked
      I = ignored
        = origin of the previous file listed as A (added)

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -A, --all        show status of all files
    -m, --modified   show only modified files
    -a, --added      show only added files
    -r, --removed    show only removed files
    -d, --deleted    show only deleted (but tracked) files
    -c, --clean      show only files without changes
    -u, --unknown    show only unknown (not tracked) files
    -i, --ignored    show only ignored files
    -n, --no-status  hide status prefix
    -C, --copies     show source of copied files
    -0, --print0     end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
    --rev            show difference from revision
    --change         list the changed files of a revision
    -I, --include    include names matching the given patterns
    -X, --exclude    exclude names matching the given patterns

    aliases: st

.. _summary:

``summary [--remote]``
    This generates a brief summary of the working directory state,
    including parents, branch, commit status, and available updates.

    With the --remote option, this will check the default paths for
    incoming and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    --remote  check for push and pull

    aliases: sum

.. _tag:

``tag [-f] [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME...``
    Name a particular revision using <name>.

    Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
    very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
    earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc.

    If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
    used, or tip if no revision is checked out.

    To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
    they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
    similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
    necessary. The file '.hg/localtags' is used for local tags (not
    shared among repositories).

    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision
    lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -f, --force    replace existing tag
    -l, --local    make the tag local
    -r, --rev      revision to tag
    --remove       remove a tag
    -e, --edit     edit commit message
    -m, --message  use <text> as commit message
    -d, --date     record datecode as commit date
    -u, --user     record the specified user as committer

.. _tags:

``tags``
    This lists both regular and local tags. When the -v/--verbose
    switch is used, a third column "local" is printed for local tags.

    Returns 0 on success.

.. _tip:

``tip [-p] [-g]``
    The tip revision (usually just called the tip) is the changeset
    most recently added to the repository (and therefore the most
    recently changed head).

    If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If
    you have just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of
    that repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special
    and cannot be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.

    Returns 0 on success.

    options:

    -p, --patch  show patch
    -g, --git    use git extended diff format
    --style      display using template map file
    --template   display with template

.. _unbundle:

``unbundle [-u] FILE...``
    Apply one or more compressed changegroup files generated by the
    bundle command.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update has unresolved files.

    options:

    -u, --update  update to new branch head if changesets were unbundled

.. _update:

``update [-c] [-C] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]``
    Update the repository's working directory to the specified
    changeset.

    If no changeset is specified, attempt to update to the tip of the
    current branch. If this changeset is a descendant of the working
    directory's parent, update to it, otherwise abort.

    The following rules apply when the working directory contains
    uncommitted changes:

    1. If neither -c/--check nor -C/--clean is specified, and if
       the requested changeset is an ancestor or descendant of
       the working directory's parent, the uncommitted changes
       are merged into the requested changeset and the merged
       result is left uncommitted. If the requested changeset is
       not an ancestor or descendant (that is, it is on another
       branch), the update is aborted and the uncommitted changes
       are preserved.

    2. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the
       uncommitted changes are preserved.

    3. With the -C/--clean option, uncommitted changes are discarded and
       the working directory is updated to the requested changeset.

    Use null as the changeset to remove the working directory (like
    :hg:`clone -U`).

    If you want to update just one file to an older changeset, use :hg:`revert`.

    See :hg:`help dates` for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

    options:

    -C, --clean  discard uncommitted changes (no backup)
    -c, --check  check for uncommitted changes
    -d, --date   tipmost revision matching date
    -r, --rev    revision

    aliases: up checkout co

.. _verify:

``verify``
    Verify the integrity of the current repository.

    This will perform an extensive check of the repository's
    integrity, validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in
    the changelog, manifest, and tracked files, as well as the
    integrity of their crosslinks and indices.

    Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

.. _version:

``version``
    output version and copyright information

.. _config:

Configuration Files
-------------------

Mercurial reads configuration data from several files, if they exist.
Below we list the most specific file first.

On Windows, these configuration files are read:

- ``<repo>\.hg\hgrc``
- ``%USERPROFILE%\.hgrc``
- ``%USERPROFILE%\mercurial.ini``
- ``%HOME%\.hgrc``
- ``%HOME%\mercurial.ini``
- ``C:\mercurial\mercurial.ini`` (unless regkey or hgrc.d\ or mercurial.ini found)
- ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mercurial`` (unless hgrc.d\ or mercurial.ini found)
- ``<hg.exe-dir>\hgrc.d\*.rc`` (unless mercurial.ini found)
- ``<hg.exe-dir>\mercurial.ini``

On Unix, these files are read:

- ``<repo>/.hg/hgrc``
- ``$HOME/.hgrc``
- ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc``
- ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc``
- ``<install-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc``
- ``<install-root>/etc/mercurial/hgrc.d/*.rc``

If there is a per-repository configuration file which is not owned by
the active user, Mercurial will warn you that the file is skipped::

  not trusting file <repo>/.hg/hgrc from untrusted user USER, group GROUP

If this bothers you, the warning can be silenced (the file would still
be ignored) or trust can be established. Use one of the following
settings, the syntax is explained below:

- ``ui.report_untrusted = False``
- ``trusted.users = USER``
- ``trusted.groups = GROUP``

The configuration files for Mercurial use a simple ini-file format. A
configuration file consists of sections, led by a ``[section]`` header
and followed by ``name = value`` entries::

  [ui]
  username = Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@example.net>
  verbose = True

The above entries will be referred to as ``ui.username`` and
``ui.verbose``, respectively. Please see the hgrc man page for a full
description of the possible configuration values:

- on Unix-like systems: ``man hgrc``
- online: http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hgrc.5.html

.. _dates:

Date Formats
------------

Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:

- backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
- log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:

- ``Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006`` (local timezone assumed)
- ``Dec 6 13:18 -0600`` (year assumed, time offset provided)
- ``Dec 6 13:18 UTC`` (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
- ``Dec 6`` (midnight)
- ``13:18`` (today assumed)
- ``3:39`` (3:39AM assumed)
- ``3:39pm`` (15:39)
- ``2006-12-06 13:18:29`` (ISO 8601 format)
- ``2006-12-6 13:18``
- ``2006-12-6``
- ``12-6``
- ``12/6``
- ``12/6/6`` (Dec 6 2006)

Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:

- ``1165432709 0`` (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)

This is the internal representation format for dates. unixtime is the
number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00 UTC). offset is
the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative if
the timezone is east of UTC).

The log command also accepts date ranges:

- ``<{datetime}`` - at or before a given date/time
- ``>{datetime}`` - on or after a given date/time
- ``{datetime} to {datetime}`` - a date range, inclusive
- ``-{days}`` - within a given number of days of today

.. _patterns:

File Name Patterns
------------------

Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files
at a time.

By default, Mercurial treats filenames as shell-style extended glob
patterns.

Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with
``path:``. These path names must completely match starting at the
current repository root.

To use an extended glob, start a name with ``glob:``. Globs are rooted
at the current directory; a glob such as ``*.c`` will only match files
in the current directory ending with ``.c``.

The supported glob syntax extensions are ``**`` to match any string
across path separators and ``{a,b}`` to mean "a or b".

To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with ``re:``.
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.

Plain examples::

  path:foo/bar   a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                 of the repository
  path:path:name a file or directory named "path:name"

Glob examples::

  glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
  *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
  **.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
                 current directory including itself.
  foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
  foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
                 including itself.

Regexp examples::

  re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository

.. _environment:
.. _env:

Environment Variables
---------------------

HG
    Path to the 'hg' executable, automatically passed when running
    hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
    the hg executable's name if it's frozen, or an executable named
    'hg' (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
    Windows) is searched.

HGEDITOR
    This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

HGENCODING
    This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
    This setting is used to convert data including usernames,
    changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can
    be overridden with the --encoding command-line option.

HGENCODINGMODE
    This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling unknown characters
    while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
    causes Mercurial to abort if it can't map a character. Other
    settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and
    "ignore", which drops them. This setting can be overridden with
    the --encodingmode command-line option.

HGMERGE
    An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
    will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
    ancestor file.

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

HGRCPATH
    A list of files or directories to search for hgrc files. Item
    separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If HGRCPATH is not set,
    platform default search path is used. If empty, only the .hg/hgrc
    from the current repository is read.

    For each element in HGRCPATH:

    - if it's a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
    - otherwise, the file itself will be added

HGPLAIN
    When set, this disables any options in .hgrc that might change
    Mercurial's default output. This includes encoding, defaults,
    verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
    localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial
    in the face of existing user configuration.

    Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment
    variables are not overridden.

HGUSER
    This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
    available values will be considered in this order:

    - HGUSER (deprecated)
    - hgrc files from the HGRCPATH
    - EMAIL
    - interactive prompt
    - LOGNAME (with ``@hostname`` appended)

    (deprecated, use .hgrc)

EMAIL
    May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

LOGNAME
    May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

VISUAL
    This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.

EDITOR
    Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
    user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The
    editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
    variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
    non-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
    defaults to 'vi'.

PYTHONPATH
    This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
    set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system-wide.

.. _revs:
.. _revisions:

Specifying Single Revisions
---------------------------

Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.

A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip,
-2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.

A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
identifier.

A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form
identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix
of exactly one full-length identifier.

Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is a
symbolic name associated with a revision identifier. A branch name
denotes the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch names must
not contain the ":" character.

The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies the
most recent revision.

The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.

The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first
parent.

.. _mrevs:
.. _multirevs:

Specifying Multiple Revisions
-----------------------------

When Mercurial accepts more than one revision, they may be specified
individually, or provided as a topologically continuous range,
separated by the ":" character.

The syntax of range notation is [BEGIN]:[END], where BEGIN and END are
revision identifiers. Both BEGIN and END are optional. If BEGIN is not
specified, it defaults to revision number 0. If END is not specified,
it defaults to the tip. The range ":" thus means "all revisions".

If BEGIN is greater than END, revisions are treated in reverse order.

A range acts as a closed interval. This means that a range of 3:5
gives 3, 4 and 5. Similarly, a range of 9:6 gives 9, 8, 7, and 6.

.. _revsets:

Specifying Revision Sets
------------------------

Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
revisions.

The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix
operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

Identifiers such as branch names must be quoted with single or double
quotes if they contain characters outside of
``[._a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff]`` or if they match one of the predefined
predicates. Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by
escaping them, e.g., ``\n`` is interpreted as a newline.

There is a single prefix operator:

``not x``
  Changesets not in x. Short form is ``! x``.

These are the supported infix operators:

``x::y``
  A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and
  ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If the first endpoint
  is left out, this is equivalent to ``ancestors(y)``, if the second
  is left out it is equivalent to ``descendants(x)``.

  An alternative syntax is ``x..y``.

``x:y``
  All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both
  inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and
  tip.

``x and y``
  The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is ``x & y``.

``x or y``
  The union of changesets in x and y. There are two alternative short
  forms: ``x | y`` and ``x + y``.

``x - y``
  Changesets in x but not in y.

The following predicates are supported:

``adds(pattern)``
  Changesets that add a file matching pattern.

``all()``
  All changesets, the same as ``0:tip``.

``ancestor(single, single)``
  Greatest common ancestor of the two changesets.

``ancestors(set)``
  Changesets that are ancestors of a changeset in set.

``author(string)``
  Alias for ``user(string)``.

``branch(set)``
  The branch names are found for changesets in set, and the result is
  all changesets belonging to one those branches.

``children(set)``
  Child changesets of changesets in set.

``closed()``
  Changeset is closed.

``contains(pattern)``
  Revision contains pattern.

``date(interval)``
  Changesets within the interval, see :hg:`help dates`.

``descendants(set)``
  Changesets which are decendants of changesets in set.

``file(pattern)``
  Changesets which manually affected files matching pattern.

``follow()``
  An alias for ``::.`` (ancestors of the working copy's first parent).

``grep(regex)``
  Like ``keyword(string)`` but accepts a regex.

``head()``
  Changeset is a head.

``heads(set)``
  Members of set with no children in set.

``keyword(string)``
  Search commit message, user name, and names of changed files for
  string.

``limit(set, n)``
  First n members of set.

``max(set)``
  Changeset with highest revision number in set.

``merge()``
  Changeset is a merge changeset.

``modifies(pattern)``
  Changesets which modify files matching pattern.

``outgoing([path])``
  Changesets missing in path.

``p1(set)``
  First parent of changesets in set.

``p2(set)``
  Second parent of changesets in set.

``parents(set)``
  The set of all parents for all changesets in set.

``removes(pattern)``
  Changesets which remove files matching pattern.

``reverse(set)``
  Reverse order of set.

``roots(set)``
  Changesets with no parent changeset in set.

``sort(set[, [-]key...])``
  Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending, specify a key
  as ``-key`` to sort in descending order.

  The keys can be:

  - ``rev`` for the revision number,
  - ``branch`` for the branch name,
  - ``desc`` for the commit message (description),
  - ``user`` for user name (``author`` can be used as an alias),
  - ``date`` for the commit date

``tagged()``
  Changeset is tagged.

``user(string)``
  User name is string.

Command line equivalents for :hg:`log`::

  -f    ->  ::.
  -d x  ->  date(x)
  -k x  ->  keyword(x)
  -m    ->  merge()
  -u x  ->  user(x)
  -b x  ->  branch(x)
  -P x  ->  !::x
  -l x  ->  limit(expr, x)

Some sample queries::

  hg log -r 'branch(default)'
  hg log -r 'branch(default) and 1.5:: and not merge()'
  hg log -r '1.3::1.5 and keyword(bug) and file("hgext/*")'
  hg log -r 'sort(date("May 2008"), user)'
  hg log -r '(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tagged())'

.. _diffs:

Diff Formats
------------

Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two versions of
a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be
used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.

While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:

- executable status and other permission bits
- copy or rename information
- changes in binary files
- creation or deletion of empty files

Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced
by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this
format.

This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with :hg:`export`), you should be careful about things like file
copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when
applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.

To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the --git
option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in the [diff]
section of your hgrc. You do not need to set this option when
importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.

.. _templating:
.. _templates:

Template Usage
--------------

Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template from the command
line, via the --template option, or select an existing
template-style (--style).

You can customize output for any "log-like" command: log,
outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, heads and glog.

Four styles are packaged with Mercurial: default (the style used
when no explicit preference is passed), compact, changelog,
and xml.
Usage::

    $ hg log -r1 --style changelog

A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
expansion::

    $ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
    b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746

Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These
keywords are usually available for templating a log-like command:

:author: String. The unmodified author of the changeset.

:branches: String. The name of the branch on which the changeset was
    committed. Will be empty if the branch name was default.

:date: Date information. The date when the changeset was committed.

:desc: String. The text of the changeset description.

:diffstat: String. Statistics of changes with the following format:
    "modified files: +added/-removed lines"

:files: List of strings. All files modified, added, or removed by this
    changeset.

:file_adds: List of strings. Files added by this changeset.

:file_copies: List of strings. Files copied in this changeset with
    their sources.

:file_copies_switch: List of strings. Like "file_copies" but displayed
    only if the --copied switch is set.

:file_mods: List of strings. Files modified by this changeset.

:file_dels: List of strings. Files removed by this changeset.

:node: String. The changeset identification hash, as a 40-character
    hexadecimal string.

:parents: List of strings. The parents of the changeset.

:rev: Integer. The repository-local changeset revision number.

:tags: List of strings. Any tags associated with the changeset.

:latesttag: String. Most recent global tag in the ancestors of this
    changeset.

:latesttagdistance: Integer. Longest path to the latest tag.

The "date" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process
it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input
variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first when you're
applying a string-input filter to a list-like input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output::

   $ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
   2008-08-21 18:22 +0000

List of filters:

:addbreaks: Any text. Add an XHTML "<br />" tag before the end of
    every line except the last.

:age: Date. Returns a human-readable date/time difference between the
    given date/time and the current date/time.

:basename: Any text. Treats the text as a path, and returns the last
    component of the path after splitting by the path separator
    (ignoring trailing separators). For example, "foo/bar/baz" becomes
    "baz" and "foo/bar//" becomes "bar".

:stripdir: Treat the text as path and strip a directory level, if
    possible. For example, "foo" and "foo/bar" becomes "foo".

:date: Date. Returns a date in a Unix date format, including the

.. _urls:

URL Paths
---------

Valid URLs are of the form::

  local/filesystem/path[#revision]
  file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
  http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
  https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
  ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]

Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by :hg:`bundle` or :hg:`
incoming --bundle`).

An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
changeset to use from the remote repository. See also :hg:`help
revisions`.

Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are only
possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial
server.

Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:

- SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
  and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as remotecmd.
- path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default. Use
  an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path::

    ssh://example.com//tmp/repository

- Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
  to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.::

    Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
      Compression no
    Host *
      Compression yes

  Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your hgrc or
  with the --ssh command line option.

These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under the
[paths] section like so::

  [paths]
  alias1 = URL1
  alias2 = URL2
  ...

You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
example :hg:`pull alias1` will be treated as :hg:`pull URL1`).

Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when
you do not provide the URL to a command:

default:
  When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
  the location of the source repository as the new repository's
  'default' path. This is then used when you omit path from push- and
  pull-like commands (including incoming and outgoing).

default-push:
  The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and
  prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.

.. _extensions:

Using additional features
-------------------------

Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
implement hooks.

Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced
usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such
as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready
for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock
Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as
needed.

To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in
the Python search path, create an entry for it in your hgrc, like
this::

  [extensions]
  foo =

You may also specify the full path to an extension::

  [extensions]
  myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

To explicitly disable an extension enabled in an hgrc of broader
scope, prepend its path with !::

  [extensions]
  # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
  bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
  # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
  baz = !

disabled extensions:

 :acl:           hooks for controlling repository access
 :bookmarks:     track a line of development with movable markers
 :bugzilla:      hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker
 :children:      command to display child changesets

 :zeroconf:      discover and advertise repositories on the local network

.. _hgweb:

Configuring hgweb
-----------------

Mercurial's internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single
repository, or a collection of them. In the latter case, a special
configuration file can be used to specify the repository paths to use
and global web configuration options.

This file uses the same syntax as hgrc configuration files, but only
the following sections are recognized:

  - web
  - paths
  - collections

The ``web`` section can specify all the settings described in the web
section of the hgrc documentation.

The ``paths`` section provides mappings of physical repository
paths to virtual ones. For instance::

  [paths]
  projects/a = /foo/bar
  projects/b = /baz/quux
  web/root = /real/root/*
  / = /real/root2/*
  virtual/root2 = /real/root2/**

- The first two entries make two repositories in different directories
  appear under the same directory in the web interface
- The third entry maps every Mercurial repository found in '/real/root'
  into 'web/root'. This format is preferred over the [collections] one,
  since using absolute paths as configuration keys is not supported on every
  platform (especially on Windows).
- The fourth entry is a special case mapping all repositories in
  '/real/root2' in the root of the virtual directory.
- The fifth entry recursively finds all repositories under the real
  root, and maps their relative paths under the virtual root.

The ``collections`` section provides mappings of trees of physical
repositories paths to virtual ones, though the paths syntax is generally
preferred. For instance::

  [collections]
  /foo = /foo

Here, the left side will be stripped off all repositories found in the
right side. Thus ``/foo/bar`` and ``foo/quux/baz`` will be listed as
``bar`` and ``quux/baz`` respectively.

.. _glossary:

Glossary
--------

Ancestor
    Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent
    changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
    of a changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a
    changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an
    ancestor. See also: 'Descendant'.

Branch
    (Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a parent that
    is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see
    'Branch, topological'. If a topological branch is named, it becomes
    a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes
    an anonymous branch. See 'Branch, anonymous' and 'Branch, named'.

    Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed to
    a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these
    operations. Note that the term branch can also be used informally
    to describe a development process in which certain development is
    done independently of other development.This is sometimes done
    explicitly with a named branch, but it can also be done locally,
    using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.

    Example: "The experimental branch".

    (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in
    its parent having more than one child.

    Example: "I'm going to branch at X".

Branch, anonymous
    Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not
    a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anonymous
    branch is created.

Branch, closed
    A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.

Branch, default
    The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has previously been
    assigned.

Branch head
    See 'Head, branch'.

Branch, named
    A collection of changesets which have the same branch name. By
    default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
    same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a
    different branch. See :hg:`help branch`, :hg:`help branches` and
    :hg:`commit --close-branch` for more information on managing
    branches.

    Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace, dividing
    the collection of changesets that comprise the repository into a
    collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not necessarily
    a topological branch. If a new named branch is created from the
    head of another named branch, or the default branch, but no
    further changesets are added to that previous branch, then that
    previous branch will be a branch in name only.

Branch tip
    See 'Tip, branch'.

Branch, topological
    Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is
    not a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological
    branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological
    branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the
    current, possibly default, branch.

Changelog
    A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added
    to the repository. This includes details such as changeset id,
    author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.

Changeset
    A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.

Changeset, child
    The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is
    a child of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a
    changeset may have.

Changeset id
    A SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be
    represented as either a "long" 40-byte hexadecimal string, or a
    "short" 12-byte hexadecimal string.

Changeset, merge
    A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is
    committed.

Changeset, parent
    A revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a
    parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node
    immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at most two
    parents.

Checkout
    (Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific
    revision. This use should probably be avoided where possible, as
    changeset is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.

    Example: "I'm using checkout X."

    (Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See
    :hg:`help update`.

    Example: "I'm going to check out changeset X."

Child changeset
    See 'Changeset, child'.

Close changeset
    See 'Changeset, close'.

Closed branch
    See 'Branch, closed'.

Clone
    (Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The partial
    clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.

    Example: "Is your clone up to date?".

    (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using :hg:`clone`.

    Example: "I'm going to clone the repository".

Closed branch head
    See 'Head, closed branch'.

Commit
    (Noun) A synonym for changeset.

    Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"

    (Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When files
    are committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the
    differences between the committed files and their parent
    changeset, creating a new changeset in the repository.

    Example: "You should commit those changes now."

Cset
    A common abbreviation of the term changeset.

DAG
    The repository of changesets of a distributed version control
    system (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
    consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
    changesets and edges imply a parent -> child relation. This graph
    can be visualized by graphical tools such as :hg:`glog`
    (graphlog). In Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement
    for children to have at most two parents.

Default branch
    See 'Branch, default'.

Descendant
    Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
    from a given changeset. More precisely, the descendants of a
    changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a
    changeset is a descendant, and the child of a descendant is a
    descendant. See also: 'Ancestor'.

Diff
    (Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files
    in two changesets or a changeset and the current working
    directory. The difference is usually represented in a standard
    form called a "diff" or "patch". The "git diff" format is used
    when the changes include copies, renames, or changes to file
    attributes, none of which can be represented/handled by classic
    "diff" and "patch".

    Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"

    (Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or
    patch.

    Example: "If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean."

Directory, working
    The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by
    Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next commit. The working
    directory initially corresponds to the snapshot at an existing
    changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See
    'Parent, working directory'. The state may be modified by changes
    to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository
    metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.

Graph
    See DAG and :hg:`help graphlog`.

Head
    The term 'head' may be used to refer to both a branch head or a
    repository head, depending on the context. See 'Head, branch' and
    'Head, repository' for specific definitions.

    Heads are where development generally takes place and are the
    usual targets for update and merge operations.

Head, branch
    A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.

Head, closed branch
    A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed
    head is no longer listed by :hg:`heads`. A branch is considered
    closed when all its heads are closed and consequently is not
    listed by :hg:`branches`.

Head, repository
    A topological head which has not been closed.

Head, topological
    A changeset with no children in the repository.

History, immutable
    Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions which
    appear to change history actually create new changesets that
    replace existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing
    so in public repositories can result in old changesets being
    reintroduced to the repository.

History, rewriting
    The changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions
    to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in such
    a way as to preserve changeset contents.

Immutable history
    See 'History, immutable'.

Merge changeset
    See 'Changeset, merge'.

Manifest
    Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are
    tracked by the changeset.

Merge
    Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update
    to a changeset and then merge another changeset, you bring the
    history of the latter changeset into your working directory. Once
    conflicts are resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed
    as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.

Named branch
    See 'Branch, named'.

Null changeset
    The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly-initialized
    repositories and repositories with no checked out revision. It is
    thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when
    merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias 'null'
    or by the changeset ID '000000000000'.

Parent
    See 'Changeset, parent'.

Parent changeset
    See 'Changeset, parent'.

Parent, working directory
    The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which is
    the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted
    merge) shown by :hg:`parents`. This is changed with
    :hg:`update`. Other commands to see the working directory parent
    are :hg:`summary` and :hg:`id`. Can be specified by the alias ".".

Patch
    (Noun) The product of a diff operation.

    Example: "I've sent you my patch."

    (Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one
    changeset into another.

    Example: "You will need to patch that revision."

Pull
    An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which are
    not in the local repository are brought into the local
    repository. Note that this operation without special arguments
    only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the
    working directory. See :hg:`help pull`.

Push
    An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are
    not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note
    that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed
    locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes are not
    sent. See :hg:`help push`.

Repository
    The metadata describing all recorded states of a collection of
    files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A
    repository is usually (but not always) found in the ``.hg``
    subdirectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be
    recreated by "updating" a working directory to a specific
    changeset.

Repository head
    See 'Head, repository'.

Revision
    A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions
    can be updated to by using :hg:`update`.  See also 'Revision
    number'; See also 'Changeset'.

Revision number
    This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific
    repository. It represents the order in which changesets were added
    to a repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that the
    revision number may be different in each clone of a repository. To
    identify changesets uniquely between different clones, see
    'Changeset id'.

Revlog
    History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form of delta
    encoding, with occasional full revision of data followed by delta
    of each successive revision. It includes data and an index
    pointing to the data.

Rewriting history
    See 'History, rewriting'.

Root
    A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most
    repositories have only a single root changeset.

Tip
    The changeset with the highest revision number. It is the changeset
    most recently added in a repository.

Tip, branch
    The head of a given branch with the highest revision number. When
    a branch name is used as a revision identifier, it refers to the
    branch tip. See also 'Branch, head'. Note that because revision
    numbers may be different in different repository clones, the
    branch tip may be different in different cloned repositories.

Update
    (Noun) Another synonym of changeset.

    Example: "I've pushed an update".

    (Verb) This term is usually used to describe updating the state of
    the working directory to that of a specific changeset. See
    :hg:`help update`.

    Example: "You should update".

Working directory
    See 'Directory, working'.

Working directory parent
    See 'Parent, working directory'.
